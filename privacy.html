        <h1>Privacy Policy for NexusKit</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date: December 9, 2025</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>NexusKit is designed to be a local-first utility. We generally do not collect personal data from users of this application, as all tool functions (Age Calculator, Converters, Generators) run entirely in your web browser. No data is sent to our servers.</p>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>This application may use third-party services, such as the QR code generation API, which may have their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing the policies of any external services.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since user data is not stored or transmitted by NexusKit, the risk associated with data breaches is minimal.</p>

        <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
